🧠 Pokémon MCP Team Builder
A smart web application that helps you build a Pokémon team using natural language!
Just describe your strategy (like "I want a team with strong attackers and at least one water type"), and it builds the team for you.
The system uses AI, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and PokéAPI data.
